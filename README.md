## Simple Boot Sector With Program

This is my simple boot sector written in NASM, with a program written in C. Finally
got it to load correctly and fixed my printf. Now it all works.

## Notes

 - Finish implementing my simple custom file system table.
 - Load executables (.APP extension only).
 - Make a shell program launch from IO.SYS (use IO.SYS as stage2 loader).
 - More (when I think of it).

## Screen shots (More to come)
